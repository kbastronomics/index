# LumenPnP

The LumenPnP is an open source [pick and place machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-and-place_machine) that reliably and accurately assembles electronic components onto circuit boards.

The LumenPnP is available for sale on the [Opulo Website](https://www.opulo.io/products/lumenpnp). Machines are being used in active production daily. If you build or buy one, please help the project by documenting bugs with a GitHub issue.

**Please [read the wiki here](https://github.com/opulo-inc/lumenpnp/wiki)!** The wiki covers information about the state of the project, contributing instructions, and frequently asked questions.

Along with the pick and place machine itself, the project also includes feeders designed to work with the machine. The source for powered feeders can be found [in their separate repository](https://github.com/opulo-inc/feeder).

For exported versions of the source (STLs, schematic PDFs, compiled binaries, etc), you can find them attached to the [latest release](https://github.com/opulo-inc/lumenpnp/releases).

The LumenPnP's development process is being cataloged in a series of videos. A playlist of these can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIeJXmcg1baLBz3x0nCDqkYpKs2IWGHk4).
